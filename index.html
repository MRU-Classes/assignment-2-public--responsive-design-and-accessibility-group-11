               <p class="intro">
                  Being a student at Mount Royal University myself, I've discovered that one of the most crucial abilities to develop is time management.
                  It's simple to feel overwhelmed by classes, homework, part-time jobs, and attempting to keep up a social life. 
                  Setting priorities, avoiding procrastination, and staying organized with calendars and to-do lists are all components of good time management. 
                  It's not only about completing more tasks; it's also about working more efficiently and scheduling time for both personal and academic objectives. 
                  You can improve your academic experience, lower stress levels, and increase productivity by developing good time management skills.
